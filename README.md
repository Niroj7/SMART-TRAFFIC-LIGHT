This project is an Arduino-based Smart Traffic Light System designed to reduce traffic congestion, improve emergency response time, and enhance intersection safety.
It uses real-time sensors, dynamic signal timing, and boom barriers to adapt traffic flow based on actual vehicle density.
This system was tested across multiple scenarios and was presented and published through an IEEE.

🔧 How It Works

Sensors detect vehicle density in each lane Sound sensor identifies emergency vehicle sirens Arduino adjusts green/red timing dynamically Boom barriers 
lower during red lights to prevent violations Optional smartphone control allows manual override

🧪 Test Scenarios

Normal Traffic Flow: Stable 6s red/green, 3s yellow

Emergency Vehicle Mode: Priority green for emergency lanes

Density-Based Control: Longer green time for high-traffic lanes

Boom Barrier Control: Barriers lower during red, raise during green

Manual Override: Smartphone successfully opened barriers within 1–2 seconds

🎯 Key Features

Real-time adaptive traffic control

Emergency vehicle prioritization

Automatic boom barrier operation

Manual override via smartphone

Low-cost, scalable system for smart cities

📌 Summary

This project demonstrates how simple IoT hardware and sensor-driven logic can solve real urban traffic challenges by improving efficiency, safety, and emergency response times.
